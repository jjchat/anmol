Data Analysis and Data Visualization for Computational Physics Research.

The initial aim of this project is to bring together all the python scripts, which have been written for data analysis and visualization over last several years in the course of fulfillment of different research projects, under one platform so that any enthusiast and new researcher in this field can start extracting results from raw data with investing very little effort in scripting. 

Another aim is to provide insights about the algorithms used to perform an operation so that the beginners can start developing their own python scripts. 

The software would launch a graphical user interface (GUI) from which most of the operations can be performed using mouse/touchpad. It will pop up with two choices: Analysis and Visualization keys. It will flow from there.  

Finally, we do hope that the project will not solely be confined within a small domain of scientific field, but rather it will lead us to many interesting collaborative works that will further serve many diversified research.
